The script to draw geometry of 1Ton WbLS detector.
- the file 'BNL1ton.geo' is used as the geometry configuration file of RAT-PAC
- the file 'draw_detector_geometry_20180504.C' can draw projection figure of detector geometry
- the file 'PMTCHARGE.ratdb' is the SPE charge response spectrum of  PMTs 
- the file 'PMT_cylindrical.ratdb' is the geometry size and  other configuration PMTs
- the  file  'PMTINFO_S0.ratdb' is the position of PMT inside the detector
