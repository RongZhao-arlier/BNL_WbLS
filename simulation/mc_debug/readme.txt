the wave length of photons
check the spectrum of attenuation
with attenuation length of water =20m
use wavelength of photons 420nm, 450nm,350nm, 380nm, 400nm
## the water attenaution length


## the path length of photons and stopping z position

## check the geometry of PMT
## determine if photon that hits PMT creates a PE
## visualization
